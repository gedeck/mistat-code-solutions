# Digital Twin
The term _digital twin_ is defined in different forms including as a
high-fidelity simulation, a virtual organization, a virtual reality
representation and an emulation facility. Its uses are in deploying
optimization, monitoring, diagnostic, prognostic and prescriptive
capabilities. The
digital twin originated with the concept of a digital factory and is the digital
representation of a physical asset or system, across its life-cycle,
using operational real-time data and other sources, adopted to drive
business outcomes.

The digital twin concept has been implemented by leading manufacturing
companies. Ford Motor Company enhanced assembly line performance by
evaluating and optimizing the designs using digital twins.
Volvo Group Globalshowed how to
validate changes using a digital twin. General Electric developed
digital twins of aircraft engines.  Major commercial software vendors
support development of virtual factories via integrated solutions
for product, process and system design, simulation, and visualization. 

The recent concept of _Industry 4.0_, or the fourth industrial revolution,
includes Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
as a key component. The function of
CPS is the monitoring of physical processes and creating a virtual
copy of the physical world to support decentralized decision-making.  In Industry 4.0 applications,
one sees a growing role of twinning a physical plant with simulation-based
surrogates. By means of sensors, real-time data about physical items are
collected and used to duplicate the physical state of the item and assess
the impact of ongoing changes.
Digital twins include  five main components: physical part, virtual part,
connection, data, and service. The virtual and physical parts exchange
information collected through the connection part. The interaction
between the human and the digital twin is provided by the service part.
Digital twins are traditionally used to improve the performance of
engineering devices, like wind turbines or jet engines. In this context,
they also serve to model systems of devices, to collect and analyze
information about processes and people, and to help solve complex problems.
Such digital twins provide powerful planning and troubleshooting
capabilities and statistical methods play a significant role in both the
design and analysis of simulations and 
computer experiments on digital
twin platforms. Digital twin provide a platform that enables a life 
cycle perspective on products and systems. This emphasizes a transition 
from engineering the design to engineering the performance.
