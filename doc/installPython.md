# Getting Started with Python
Python is a powerful, general purpose programming language that can be used for many applications ranging from short scripts to enterprise applications. There is a large and growing number of free, open-source libraries and tools for scientific computing. For more information about Python and its use visit [python.org.](https://www.python.org/).

## Install Python
There are many ways of using and developing with Python. However, a good start will be to use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive, browser-based Python interface available through the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) which is particularly useful for scientific computing. We will be using Python 3.8 or newer. 

Here is what you need to do:

- Download the Anaconda installer for Python 3.8 or later from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ for your operating system (you will be asked for your email, however this step is optional and you can proceed without providing it)
- Execute the installer
  - macOS: double-click on the pkg file and follow the instructions using the default settings
  - Windows: run the exe file and follow the instructions using default settings
  - During installation of Anaconda, you are asked if you want to install DataSpell. This is optional, but can be a useful tool to get you started using Jupyter Notebooks.
 - Once the application is installed, you can execute Anaconda Navigator from the Start Menu (Windows) and the Application folder (macOS)

If you donâ€™t want to use Anaconda, you will find installation instructions for Windows 10 at the end of this document.

## Anaconda Navigator â€“ update and install packages
You can use _Anaconda Navigator_ to manage your Python installation and run the Jupyter application. 

Use the _Environments_ tab to add packages to your Python installation.

Click the [Update indexâ€¦] button to refresh the package list. From time to time, it may ask you to update the Anaconda Navigator application. Itâ€™s good practice to update regularly. 
If new versions become available, you will see that the version number changes. The version number of updatable packages are highlighted in blue and with a 
This means that you can update the specific package. Change the pull-down menu to [Updatable] and click the green tick mark to select [Mark for update]. Do that for all the packages you want to update, select [Apply] and confirm the update. 
Once you initiated the update, use the [Clear] button to remove the marking. Anaconda Navigator otherwise will indicate that it is busy when you want to close the application. 

Updates are done in the background and will take some time and may require confirmation.  There is no feedback that an update is finished. You will need to refresh the list using [Update indexâ€¦] to see the progress.
You will not need to update all packages, however update at least the following packages required for the course:
Python: the Python interpreter 
Matplotlib: Python 2D plotting library (https://matplotlib.org/)
networkx: Python package for creating and manipulating complex networks (https://networkx.github.io/)
NumPy: fundamental package for scientific computing with Python (https://www.numpy.org/)
Pandas: high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
scikit-learn: machine learning in Python (http://scikit-learn.org/)
seaborn: statistical data visualization (https://seaborn.pydata.org/) 
statsmodels: implementation of different statistical models and tests (https://www.statsmodels.org/)
Install the following:
cartopy: a library providing cartographic tools for Python (http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/). Only required if you want to run all examples from the book
graphviz: Application to visualize graphs (https://www.graphviz.org/) 
python-graphviz: Python interface for graphviz (https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
pydotplus: Python interface to graphvizâ€™s dot language. Required to visualize decision trees (http://pydotplus.readthedocs.io/) 
gmaps: Python interface to Google maps. See appendix for details about installing this package (https://github.com/pbugnion/gmaps) 
nltk: Natural language processing toolkit. Required for more advanced text mining applications (https://www.nltk.org/) 
mlxtend: machine learning library that provides access to association rules mining algorithms (https://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend)
scikit-surprise: a library for recommender systems (http://surpriselib.com/) 
squarify: algorithm to layout tree map visualizations (https://github.com/laserson/squarify) 
twython: pure Python wrapper for the Twitter API. Supports both normal and streaming Twitter APIs (https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
To install a package, change the pull down to [Not installed] and enter e.g. matplotlib in the [Search packages] field. Click on the rectangle to select the package for download and use the [Apply] button to start the installation. 
Once the library is installed, it will be listed under the installed packages.
You can also install a library from the command line, which may be faster, by using the command
conda install packagename
In some cases, you will need to specify a special channel, e.g.
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-surprise

The gmaps and scikit-surprise Python package are available from the conda-forge channel. You can add the conda-forge channel to Anaconda Navigator. 
In the Environments tab of Anaconda Navigator, click the [Channels] button and add the conda-forge channel. Close the dialog using [Update channels].
After [Update indexâ€¦] the gmaps and scikit-surprise packages are available for installation.


Installing dmba
The package dmba (https://pypi.org/project/dmba/) provides a number of utility functions that are used throughout the book. It is available through PyPI, the Python package index, and can be installed using the command 

pip install dmba 

on the command line.
You can also install packages from a Jupyter notebook using the following commands. You will only need to do this once.

# Install a pip package in the current Jupyter kernel
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install dmba

Anaconda Navigator â€“ Launch Python in a Jupyter Notebook
We recommend that you use Jupyter notebooks for the exercises. The Jupyter notebook is a web-based computing environment that runs on your computer and embeds Python code and output together with comments and graphics in one readable document. In the last years, this has become a popular way for interactive data analysis in the data science community.
Select the Home tab in the Anaconda Navigator and Launch Jupyter notebook. The notebook is launched inside your usual web browser. The supported browsers are Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. An up-to-date version of Edge may also work; if not, use one of the supported browsers.
The Jupyter notebook application opens a file manager page which allows you to browse to your working directory. You can also create new folders [New/Folder] and text files [New/Text File] here.

To rename a file or folder select it and use [Rename] to change the name.
 
Create a folder to keep your work for the course and navigate into the folder. Next use [New/Python 3] to create a new notebook which opens in a separate tab or window.
Jupyter notebook
This is what an empty notebook looks like.

Click on Untitled and replace it with as more meaningful title.
You can enter Python code in the code boxes and execute it using the [Run] button. 

The output and result of the last statement in each code box is printed underneath each block. 
Jupyter notebooks regularly saves your work automatically. If you want to trigger the save manually, use the [ðŸ–«] button, the [File|Save and Checkpoint] menu or the [Ctrl/Cmd-S] key.
If you find an error in your code, you can modify it and rerun the code. From time to time, you may want to rerun the whole code in your notebook; use the menu [Kernel/Restart & Run All] for this.
